										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at this page and<br />
										getting to know about me, and what I can do for you.</p>
									</header>
									<p><br>Graduating with my undergraduate degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, I spent the first years of my career in the Professional
										Services field managing projects related to Talent Management, Development, and Recruitment.</br>

									  <br>While my roles were fulfilling, I decided to pursue a lifelong desire to serve in the Military and was commissioned as an Officer in the
										United States Army Signal Corp, serving in 3 bases in Georgia and Texas. It was here that I led cross-functional teams of communication
										and network specialists to conduct world-wide operations, supporting senior leaders to plan operations and logistics for over
										2,000 internal personnel.</br>

										<br>With my service nearing an end, I knew that a transition back into the private sector would require further training.
										I was then afforded the opportunity to participate in a veteran transition program, working at a small technology startup
										conducting go-to-market strategy for new markets, igniting an interest in entrepreneurship.</br>

										<br>Following this interest, I decided to return to business school and receive my Master of Business Administration from the University of Minnesota,
										emphasizing my studies in finance and entrepreneurship. It was here that I dove headfirst into entrepreneurship, taking on the role as a
										student consultant working with startups in the Technology, Restaurant, and Food & Agriculture industries.
										Alongside my academic courses, I also worked within the University’s Venture Center, assisting researchers to launch startups to
										commercialize their ideas.</br>

										<br>To further expand my experience, I accepted an internship offer at U.S. Bank as a Product Manager, focusing on payment services
										and cross-border remittances. During this time I examined initial public offerings and acquisitions of financial technology companies
										and recommended viable partnerships to senior leadership.</br>

										<br>Wanting to understand “the otherside of the table” of financing entrepreneurial ventures, I searched out opportunities and began
										working as an Investment Associate for a local Angel Investment fund where I assist in sourcing deal flow, managing due diligence, and
										member relations. This gives me a much better understanding of both investors as well as the entrepreneur.</br>

										<br>Returning to U.S. Bank after graduation, I continue to refine my career in the financial services and startup industries.</br></p>
