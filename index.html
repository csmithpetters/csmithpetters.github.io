								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Graduating with my undergraduate degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, I spent the
								first years of my career in the Professional Services field managing projects related to Talent
								Management, Development, and Recruitment.</p>
							<p>While my roles were fulfilling, I decided to pursue a lifelong desire to serve in the Military and
								was commissioned as an Officer in the United States Army Signal Corp, serving in 3 bases in Georgia and
								Texas. It was here that I led cross-functional teams of communication and network specialists to conduct
								world-wide operations, supporting senior leaders to plan operations and logistics for over 2,000 internal personnel.</p>
							<p>With my service nearing an end, I knew that a transition back into the private sector would require further
								training. I was then afforded the opportunity to participate in a veteran transition program, working at a small
								 technology startup conducting go-to-market strategy for new markets, igniting an interest in entrepreneurship.</p>
							<p>Following this interest, I decided to return to business school and receive my Master of Business Administration
								from the University of Minnesota, emphasizing my studies in finance and entrepreneurship. It was here that I dove
								headfirst into entrepreneurship, taking on the role as a student consultant working with startups in the Technology,
								Restaurant, and Food & Agriculture industries. Alongside my academic courses, I also worked within the University’s
								Venture Center, assisting researchers to launch startups to commercialize their ideas.</p>
							<p>To further expand my experience, I accepted an internship offer at U.S. Bank as a Product Manager, focusing on payment
								 services and cross-border remittances. During this time I examined initial public offerings and acquisitions of financial
								  technology companies and recommended viable partnerships to senior leadership.</p>
							<p>Wanting to understand “the otherside of the table” of financing entrepreneurial ventures, I searched out opportunities
								and began working as an Investment Associate for a local Angel Investment fund where I assist in sourcing deal flow,
								 managing due diligence, and member relations. This gives me a much better understanding of both investors as well as the entrepreneur.</p>
							<p>Returning to U.S. Bank after graduation, I continue to refine my career in the financial services industry while also
								 keeping my eye out for consulting in entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
